## Project Overview

This repository serves as a practical guide and demonstration of various JavaScript paradigms and tools. It covers essential topics from the `this` keyword and strict mode to modern asynchronous patterns (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism), and contemporary development workflows involving ES6 Modules, CommonJS, Babel for transpilation, and Webpack for module bundling.

Each concept is illustrated with clear, concise code examples, making it an excellent resource for JavaScript learners and developers looking to reinforce their understanding of core functionalities and best practices.

## Key Features

* **`this` Keyword Behavior:** Demonstrates `this` context in various scenarios (global, function, object methods, constructors, arrow functions).
* **Strict Mode:** Illustrates the impact of `"use strict"` on JavaScript behavior.
* **Asynchronous JavaScript:**
    * In-depth examples of Callback functions, including error handling and the "Callback Hell" problem.
    * Modern asynchronous patterns using Promises (`.then()`, `.catch()`).
    * Simplified asynchronous code with `async`/`await`.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    * Detailed explanations and examples of Encapsulation (using `WeakMap` and Symbols for private members).
    * Concepts of Abstraction, Inheritance (prototype-based and ES6 Classes), and Polymorphism.
    * Getters and Setters for property control.
* **JavaScript Module Systems:**
    * Implementation of CommonJS modules.
    * Implementation of ES6 Modules.
* **Build Tools:**
    * Basic setup and usage of Babel for JavaScript transpilation.
    * Introduction to Webpack for module bundling and asset management.

## Technologies Used

* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language.
* **HTML5**: For structuring web pages and embedding scripts.
* **Babel**: JavaScript compiler for transpiling modern JavaScript into backward-compatible versions.
* **Webpack**: Module bundler for JavaScript applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mrmp2010/Test-Code-Js-Part-II.git](https://github.com/mrmp2010/Test-Code-Js-Part-II.git)
    cd JavaScript-Core-Concepts-Examples
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for specific sections:**
    Some sections (like Babel and Webpack) have their own `package.json` files and require separate installations.

    * **For Babel examples:**
        ```bash
        cd "other code-2/babel"
        npm install
        # To run the babel script defined in package.json:
        npm run babel
        ```
    * **For Webpack examples:**
        ```bash
        cd "other code-2/webpack"
        npm install
        # To run webpack (usually configured in package.json scripts):
        # npm run build  (assuming a build script exists, check package.json)
        ```

### Running Examples

Most examples can be run by simply opening the corresponding `.html` files in your web browser.

* **Open `other code/index.html`** to see `strictModeTest.js` in action.
* **Open `other code/main.html`** to see `callBackTest.js` in action.
* **Open `other code/about.html`** to see `callBackTest1.js` in action.
* **Open `test code 2/index.html`** to explore a wide range of JavaScript concepts from `specs.js`.
* **Open `other code-2/moduleTest(common js)/index.html`** to see CommonJS module usage.
* **Open `other code-2/moduleTest(Es6-module)/index.html`** to see ES6 module usage.
* For Babel and Webpack examples, refer to their respective `package.json` files for scripts to build/run them. The output will typically be in a `build` or `dist` folder, which then can be served via a simple HTTP server or opened in a browser if it's an HTML file.
